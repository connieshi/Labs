# Lab1: Linker Lab

* Compile with: javac LinkerLab.java
* Run with: java LinkerLab < input.txt 

Or paste input in terminal. Does not work if you paste into console of Eclipse, for example, because Scanner in IDEs don't know when to stop reading (i.e., scanner.hasNext() will never return false).

Best way to run is to have text files of all inputs: input1.txt, input2.txt, input3.txt, etc. and running the lab to redirect standard in to file using the "<" symbol. And using the ">" symbol if you want to redirect standard out to something else, like a file.

Note that outputs 4 and 9 are incorrect on Professor Gottlieb's website.

Output 4 should have X21 = 4 in Symbol Table instead of 5, since it exceeds module size. 
Input 9 is just wrong. (Last line is "1 34561 31231", which means that the count is incorrect and cannot be parsed.) This program works with valid inputs where counts are correct.

NOTE: Variables greater than 8 characters will be treated as if it were only 8 characters long and will still be used.
